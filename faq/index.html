            <div id="what-is-met" class="answer collapse show" role="tabpanel">
              <p>Metronome ("Metronome" or "MTN") is the world's first cross-blockchain cryptocurrency. It is designed to bring institutional-class endurance to the cryptocurrency category through:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Self-governance</strong> - MTN is designed to function indefinitely and without management by a group or individual, even its authors.</li>
                <li><strong>Reliability</strong> - The system is architected for steady and predictable token supply with descending price auctions.</li>
                <li><strong>Portability</strong> - With the ability to move between blockchains, the cryptocurrency is further protected from management issues and instability.</li>

            <div id="what-can-do" class="answer collapse" role="tabpanel">
              <p lang="en">We expect that MTN will act as a store of value that is decentralized across blockchains. Since MTN can be exported and imported across chains, it empowers users to move MTN for whatever reason they desire. Other cryptocurrencies cannot do this.</p>

              <p lang="en">Cross-chain export and import of MTN provides the ability to emigrate from one blockchain to another in the event of a failure.</p>

              <p lang="en">MTN also allows for subscriptions, or recurring payments on the blockchain that are automatic. This is something cryptocurrencies have struggled with, until now—MTN users can schedule repeat payments easily.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Decentralized store of value across blockchains</li>
                <li>Advanced payment settlement:

                    <li>Mass Pay &mdash; allowing users to send tokens to multiple addresses with one action. While mass pay is a well-known and used feature on the Bitcoin network, it is lacking on the Ethereum network. </li>
                    <li>Subscriptions &mdash; allowing users to set up recurring payments between themselves and other parties. Subscription is a payment feature unique to Metronome. Users can set up recurring payments between themselves and other parties by authorizing that party to take a certain amount of MTN from a  wallet on a recurring, periodic basis.</li>

              <p lang="en">To participate in Metronome's initial supply auction (and, every day thereafter, the daily supply lot) you will need access to an ERC20-compatible Ethereum wallet where you hold the private keys and sufficient ETH to purchase MTN. <strong>Do not use wallets provided by exchanges.</strong> Be sure to use enough <a href="https://themerkle.com/why-does-the-ethereum-ecosystem-use-gas/" target="_blank">gas</a> when sending your ETH.

              <p lang="en">Following the initial auction, MTN is added to MTN’s daily supply lot (“DSL”) every 24 hours, at the rate that is the greater of (i) 2,880 MTN per day, or (ii) an annual rate equal to 2.0000% of the then-outstanding supply per year. Newly-minted MTN from the DSL enters the ecosystem via a DPA. All tokens in the DSL start at a maximum price set by the contract at the previous auction’s minimum price multiplied by two. Every 60 seconds, the price of remaining MTN is reduced to 99% of its previous price. After some time, we expect the price of remaining tokens will become low enough for the DSL to sell out. </p>
              <p lang="en">In the event that there are unsold MTN at the end of the daily auction, those tokens will be held over and added to the next DSL. For example, if 1,000 MTN went unsold, the next DSL would introduce the scheduled 2,880 MTN along with the remaining 1,000 MTN from the previous day.</p>
              <p lang="en">We expect that the mintage rate for approximately the first 40 years will be 2,880 MTN per day. After approximately 40 years, the mintage rate will be higher as shown below.</p>

            <div id="who-bloq" class="answer collapse" role="tabpanel">
              <p lang="en">Bloq was launched with a vision to help companies meet a very new challenge: integrating into a world of multiple blockchains, culminating in an "Internet of blockchains."</p>

              <p lang="en">Led by a world-class team of blockchain developers, entrepreneurs, and investors, we have developed BloqEnterprise, an open source blockchain technology that helps businesses develop blockchain-enabled solutions to address some of the biggest issues businesses are facing today.</p>

              <p lang="en">Since Bloq's inception, we've also advised on some of the the biggest projects in this space, while sponsoring open-source developers whose passions, interests, and skills aligned with ours.</p>

              <p lang="en">To bring the latter into operational focus, we started BloqLabs earlier this year to help accelerate our efforts in this area. This has been an essential part of our strategy to expand the surface area between blockchains and boardrooms, open-source and office suites.</p>

              <p lang="en">We anticipate that BloqLabs will produce a number of innovations to be presented under the "Built by Bloq" brand, one such innovations being Metronome, which aims to realize the promise (and unlock the potential) of a multi-blockchain world.</p>

            <div id="why-metronome" class="answer collapse" role="tabpanel">
              <p lang="en">We looked at the current landscape of distributed blockchain-based financial products and saw a novel opportunity to launch a cryptocurrency with equal public access and the need for a cross-chain solution. Metronome is a truly self-governed cryptocurrency that we believe is reliable, equally accessible to the public, and immune to community or individual drama.</p>

            <div id="why-the-name" class="answer collapse" role="tabpanel">
              <p lang="en">We believe the cryptocurrency's supply and issuance is predictable and constant. Our innovation needed a name that carried the same weight as its performance. The enduring beat of tokens being added to the ecosystem per day is unending and reliable, like a musical metronome that maintains a consistent cadence.</p>

            <div id="lock-up" class="answer collapse" role="tabpanel">
              <p lang="en">Bloq and other Metronome authors will receive 2 million MTN of the initial 10 million MTN offering as a one-time author's retention. 100% of the ETH proceeds of the initial token sale and 100% of the future daily supply lot ETH proceeds go to MTN's Autonomous Proceeds Provider ("APP") contracts to provide additional liquidity and price support.</p>
              <p lang="en">Bloq can buy and sell MTN at its discretion. Following the launch of the initial auction, the MTN ecosystem is entirely in the hands of the smart contracts and the community. By accepting the author's retention in MTN, Bloq has an incentive to remain active in the ecosystem's community. </p>

            <div id="govern" class="answer collapse" role="tabpanel">
              <p lang="en">No. Metronome will be governed by its smart contracts and users. Bloq plans on remaining active within the community of users and developers by continuing to grow the ecosystem with MTN-enabled and compatible products. However, after its launch, Bloq will have no more control over MTN than any other member of the MTN community.</p>
